# Movie Recommendation System


•	PROBLEM STATEMENT

To design a recommendation engine for a web-streaming app like netflix or spotify. I chose to make a website for movie streaming with a recommendation engine.

•	WHAT ARE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS? 

A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. 

•	TYPES OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS: 
 
1)	Content based: 
In Content-Based Recommender, we must build a profile for each item, which will represent the important characteristics of that item. For example, if we make a movie as an item then its actors, director, release year and genre are the most significant features of the movie. 

2)	Collaborative filtering: 
To address some of the limitations of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations

2)	Hybrid recommendation system:: 
A hybrid recommendation system is a special type of recommendation system which can be considered as the combination of the content and collaborative filtering method.

In this project i've made a "Hybrid recommendation system".
